# Gocheckit
Gocheckit is a Go tool that can be used to help identify Go modules that are potentially Deprecated.

# What does it do?
Gocheckit uses your go.mod in JSON format and analyzes the modules to determine if they might be deprecated. It does the following:
- Check a Go modules Github repo for any Deprecated Topics
- Analyze the contents of a modules README for the presence of certain keywords i.e deprecated
- Utilise your .netrc Github creds so you aren't throttled and can access Private Repos
- It's multithreaded, if you're in a rush, use those cores!
